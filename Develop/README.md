# Note-taker-App

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop an Application that allows users to create and store notes for future reference or use. As a small business owner, it is important to have an application that allows the business owner create notes that can help keep track of tasks required to be completed. This ensures the business owner is organized and also ensures that important tasks are not overlooked or completely forgotten.

This project was developed using `Express.Js` and also incorporated code libraries such as *uuid random*, *fs* e.t.c. The application is deployed on Heroku and when initialized, directs the user to an interface that enables the user type-in a Note title and Note text, after which the user saves the information. When the application is opened afterwards, previous notes are displayed on the left of the screen.



Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of Express.js. I learnt how to write Server side code with Express.Js, applying the *CRUD* methodology by making http `GET`, `POST`, `PUSH` and `DELETE` requests. I also learnt about *Middlewares* and their functionalities.
